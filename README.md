# rogātō 📜 🏷
## A functional, declarative query language with an integrated graph database.

(Still WIP)

**rogātō** aims to provide a simple yet powerful functional programming interface to a built-in graph database, powered by [indradb](https://github.com/indradb/indradb).

The syntax is inspired mostly by languages like Elm, F#, Haskell and Elixir. The goal is to provide a basic standard library for common tasks. The language is still at a very early stage, so a lot is still missing.

More information will follow here as the language matures.
For some example source code and syntax ideas (still WIP), check out the code examples under [examples/](examples/).

### Language design goals

* Simple, typed, functional core language for data processing
* Direct native access to built-in graph database
* First-class query manipulation support against graph db
* Symbolic language capabilities for easy knowledge graph construction and querying

### Why?

I needed a project to learn Rust with. I always have been interested in graph databases and their applications to data problems and have been fascinated by what declarative, logic based programming can do for simplicity in querying large data sets. **rogātō** aims to unify some of those ideas and properties into something new and cohesive that is fun and productive to use and can aid in discovering interesting facts about large data sets.
