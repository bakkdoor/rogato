## A functional, declarative query-oriented programming language with an integrated graph database.

**rogƒÅt≈ç** aims to provide a simple yet powerful functional programming interface to a built-in graph database, powered by [indradb](https://github.com/indradb/indradb).

The syntax is inspired mostly by languages like Elm, F#, Haskell and Elixir. The goal is to provide a basic standard library for common tasks. The language is still at a very early stage, so a lot is still missing.

More information will follow here as the language matures.
For some example source code and syntax ideas (still WIP), check out the code examples under [examples/](examples/).

### Language design goals

* Simple, typed, memory-safe functional core language for data processing
* Direct native access to built-in graph database
* First-class query manipulation support against graph db
* Symbolic language capabilities for easy knowledge graph construction and querying
* Easy importing of data from various data formats, ideally provided by std lib

### Build instructions

Build with cargo, Rust's package and build manager:

#### Build without optimizations (debug mode)

    cargo b

#### Build with optimizations (release mode)

    cargo b -r

#### Build with parser tracing enabled

    carbo b --features trace

This works also for release builds:

    carbo b -r --features trace

To get parser tracing viz via pegviz, run:

    ./target/release/rogato example/query.roga | pegviz --output pegviz.html

Then open pegviz.html to view parser tracing visualization.

### Q&A

#### Why?

I needed a project to learn Rust with. I always have been interested in graph databases and their applications to data problems and have been fascinated by what declarative, logic based programming can do for simplicity in querying large data sets. **rogƒÅt≈ç** aims to unify some of those ideas and properties into something new and cohesive that is fun and productive to use and can aid in discovering interesting facts about large data sets.

#### What does the name mean?

**rogƒÅt≈ç** is the ablative case of the Latin perfect passive participle of [***rogƒÅtus***](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rogatus#Latin) (having been enquired / asked / requested / invited).

###### How is it pronounced?
###### <sup>The a and final o (marked with macrons) are pronounced twice as long as the first o.</sup>
